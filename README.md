42 Paris project - miniRT

A basic RayTracer using minilibX

Goals :	introduct us to the RayTracing algorithms and to the implementation of mathematics formulas
		step up in terms of parsing and error handling

Handles :

- clean window handling (no problem when resizsd, minimized or so on)

- 5 simple geometric objects (plan, sphere, cylinder, square, triangle)

- multiple light spots (intensity, shadows, ambiant light)

- multiple cameras (pov)

- objects intersection

- color and size of objects are defined in parsing and can be modified in the input file

- transformations (translation and rotation)

- "- save" option that saves the outpout into a .bmp file

- exiting wiht the 'esc' key or the red cross button

- changing the pov with the 'space' key

- low resolution mode with the 'r' key (pressing it again will make the resolution go back to high)

- mooving the pov forward, back, left and right with the 'w', 's', 'a' and 'd' keys

- mooving the pov up and down with the 'page up' and 'page down' keys

- rotating the pov up, down, left, right with the corresponding arrow keys
